Note: The moment we copy the main.c program directly for execution it throws an error to create database. Hence, initially we have to go to create data base option and atleast two data bases of individual sudents as to be created and then check the program execution ( because my own database will be vanished if we copy the code to run in other systems)
When I worked on the main.c code I have created my own database of my class fellow mates details and worked on it. Kindly check the images and videos folder (done in CODEBLOCKS SOFTWARE) for referrence
